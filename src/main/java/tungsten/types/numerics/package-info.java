/**
 * This package contains all sub-interfaces of {@link tungsten.types.Numeric}, one each
 * for the subtypes that are supported, as well as concrete implementations in
 * {@link tungsten.types.numerics.impl}.  Currently, the supported numeric types
 * are integer, rational, real, and complex.<br>
 * This package also includes two enums necessary to support these types,
 * {@link tungsten.types.numerics.Sign} (which encapsulates whether a value is
 * negative or positive) and {@link tungsten.types.numerics.NumericHierarchy}
 * (which provides a ladder of coercibility, among other functions).
